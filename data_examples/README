Fragility Multi-Center Retrospective Study
------------------------------------------

iEEG and EEG data from 5 centers is organized here, with a total of 100 subjects. Sessions consist of 'seizures', and 'interictal' data. Acquisitions include ECoG and SEEG. Each run specifies a different snapshot of EEG data from that specific subject's session. For seizure sessions, this means that each run is a EEG snapshot around a different seizure event.

For additional clinical metadata about each subject, refer to the clinical Excel table.

Electrode coordinates were derived from from each subject with available CT images. T1 MRI images were processed with FreeSurfer, and then electrode coordinates were mapped to FreeSurfer space. 

# Data Availability (NIH, JHH, UMMC, and UMF agreed to share. Cleveland Clinic did not, so requires an additional DUA)

All data, except for Cleveland Clinic was approved by their centers to be de-identified and shared. All data in this dataset have no PHI, or other identifiers associated with patient. In order to access Cleveland Clinic data, please forward all requests to Amber Sours, SOURSA@ccf.org:

# Sourcedata
For each subject, there was a raw EDF file, which was converted into the BrainVision format with `mne_bids`. Each subject with SEEG implantation, also has an Excel table, called `electrode_layout.xlsx`, which outlines where the clinicians marked each electrode anatomically. Note that there is no rigorous atlas applied, so the main points of interest are: `WM`, `GM`, `VENTRICLE`, `CSF`, and `OUT`, which represent white-matter, gray-matter, ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid and outside the brain. WM, Ventricle, CSF and OUT were removed channels from further analysis. These were labeled in the corresponding BIDS `channels.tsv` sidecar file as `status=bad`.

# Derivatives

Derivatives include:
* fragility analysis
* frequency analysis
* graph metrics analysis
* figures

# Events and Descriptions
Within each EDF file, there contain event markers that are annotated by clinicians, which may inform you of specific clinical events that are occuring in time, or of when they saw seizures onset and offset (clinical and electrographic). 

During a seizure event, specifically event markers may follow this time course:

	* eeg onset, or clinical onset - the onset of a seizure that is either marked electrographically, or by clinical behavior. Note that the clinical onset may not always be present, since some seizures manifest without clinical behavioral changes.
	* Marker/Mark On - these are usually annotations within some cases, where a health practitioner injects a chemical marker for use in ICTAL SPECT imaging after a seizure occurs. This is commonly done to see which portions of the brain are active metabolically.
	* Marker/Mark Off - This is when the ICTAL SPECT stops imaging.
	* eeg offset, or clinical offset - this is the offset of the seizure, as determined either electrographically, or by clinical symptoms.

Other events included may be beneficial for you to understand the time-course of each seizure. Note that ICTAL SPECT occurs in all Cleveland Clinic data. Note that seizure markers are not consistent in their description naming, so one might encode some specific regular-expression rules to consistently capture seizure onset/offset markers across all dataset. In the case of UMMC data, all onset and offset markers were provided by the clinicians on an Excel sheet instead of via the EDF file. So we went in and added the annotations manually to each EDF file.
